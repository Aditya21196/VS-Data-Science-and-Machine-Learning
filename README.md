The course will be completed in lesser number of classes than shown in the curriculum and that would be decided as per need of students and pace which will get set from first class onwards.

There will be workshops and doubt clearing sessions during weekdays. In these workshops, you can provide a small use case for your lessons and we will implement that using Python or solve some sort of problem that you might face in your student/professional/personal life.

## DS lesson 1: Introduction to Python
The first lesson would be dedicated to python and everything useful it can do for us. We will try to explore as many realms of this language as possible. This will lay the foundation for the first workshop, details of which are provided down below. It would be a fast paced lesson since many students are already familiar with at least some coding language.

Main focus would be to get a native feel of Python and become comfortable with the syntax. Some small nuances and code writing style will also be discussed.

## DS lesson 2: Python continued and Introduction to numpy
In this lesson, we covered some advanced python concepts like classes, generators and inbuilt modules. We didn't cover list comprehension, it shall be covered in later lessons.

Also covered: Basics of computation using numpy

## DS lesson 3: Matplotlib and Pandas Essential Training
In this class, we covered basic data management and visualization techniques needed for ML. More shall be covered on these topics later since they are very vast.

## Workshop 1 for DS: IMS Notices Automatic Notification System
In this workshop, we will first collect email ids of all students interested in a google sheet. We will create a python script that scrapes notices from IMS notice board and if there is a unique entry (new notice not seen before), then a notification along with contents of notice is sent to all the email ids. Then we will deploy this application on a AWS backend (it can be any VPS service). We will run a cron job (scheduled task) that runs this script every day.

This entire thing should be concluded in a matter of 2-4 hours.

I will host the backend on AWS. It can be hosted on Heroku or Digital Ocean or any other VPS. I will use SendGrid API for mailing the unique notices. If you guys feel that there is some aspect of this stack that you would like to explore, then based on consensus, I will conduct a workshop for that topic too as long as it is related to Python/Data Science/Machine Learning.

## Workshop 2.1: Neural Networks (Single Layer Perceptron Models)
In this class, we covered the theory about Learning Mechanisms, extended the concept of AI to mathematical terms and also went through Logistic Regression and Linear Regression. Activation Functions and Error calculation methods were also studied.

## Workshop 2.2: Multilayer Perceptron Models
In this class, we learnt how to use matrix operations to do calculations of high complexity and how to build Multi Layer Perceptron Models. We also applied our learning to iris dataset from sklearn's datasets.

## Workshop 3: Practical Machine Learning
We built a black and white classifier which can be trained as well and deployed it using Flask on our own machines. Additionally, we needed to use HTML, JavScript and some CSS scripting but that went fine since most people did comfortably understand the syntax.

## Workshop 4: Webscraping
We learnt how to mimic GET and POST requests to get html data and how to play around with it by navigating to pages from one page onwards, extracting information from the HTML, storing the information extracted to use for various purposes etc.

## ML lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
In this class, we went through the taxonomy of AI and further focused down upon ML. Towards the end, we covered Linear Regression models along with examples.

## ML lesson 2: Decision Trees and Random Forrest Models
In this class, we learnt about how decision trees work and then applied the sklearn's in-built implementations on various datasets.
We also learnt about how Decision Trees are optimized.

## ML lesson 3: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Classification
We went through theory behind SVMs and Logistic unit.

## ML lesson 4: All Classification Algorithms
Some more Classification models were touched upon.
